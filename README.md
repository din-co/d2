Solidus-based commerce application

### Development server:
Your choice: `heroku local --port 3000 --procfile Procfile.dev` to see the website at http://localhost:3000 (which also launches `mailcatcher` on http://localhost:3100) or if you can't be bothered, `rails server` will run just the website.

#### Seeing email in development:
`gem install mailcatcher -- --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include`  (flags necessary on OS X El Capitan) and then run `mailcatcher` from the command line.

## How to Override Templates (FAQ)

- Where are the templates to copy?

`bundle show solidus_frontend`

- Where do I copy them to?

Into your local copy, under `app/views/...` in the same place as they are in the `solidus_frontend` gem, _e.g._:

``` console
$ mkdir -p app/views/spree/home
$ cp $(bundle show solidus_frontend)/app/views/spree/home/index.html.erb app/views/spree/home
```
