    <h4>Want to change the suggested meals, or cancel a delivery? </h4>
    <p>You may change or cancel your order until 5pm the night before your selected delivery, when your order is processed.</p>

    <h4>How much does subscription cost?</h4>
    <p>There is no cost for a subscription other than the cost of meals. Meal prices are set by our restaurant partners and average about $32 ($16/serving). The price of each meal will be included in the email and text message with suggested meals each week.</p>
